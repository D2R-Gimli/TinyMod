D2R : TINY MOD by Gimli#4667 (e-soni@d2jsp)


# Install instructions #
------------------------
Step 1: Go to your D2R install folder - like "C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected\" and create in there a new folder called "mods"

Step 2: Extract/copy/move the files/folders from the zip/7z file into this folder.
		It should look like: C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected\mods\tiny\tiny.mpq

Step 3: Go to your folder "C:\Users\YOURUSERNAMEHERE\Saved Games\Diablo II Resurrected" and create a folder called "mods".

Step 4: Go into that mods folder and create a folder called "tiny". In this folder you copy the file "Settings.json" from the zip/7z
		It should look like: C:\Users\YOURUSERNAMEHERE\Saved Games\Diablo II Resurrected\mods\tiny\Settings.json
		You may have to set up your ingame spell hotkeys back again (but only once)

Step 5: Open the Battle.net Launcher, click the "settings" icon (gearwheel), got to "game settings"
		Activate "additional command line arguments"
		Type in or attach to already used arguments "-mod tiny -txt"
		You can also use even more arguments like -ns for no sound for example.
		
Step 6: Start D2R and enjoy a faster game :D

Step 7: Optional: If you use a shortcut for loading with tiny mod, you can use the icon (tiny2.ico) i've made to divide the different shortcuts :)






# Option starting process #
---------------------------
Chobotz made some nice PowerShell scripts to start D2R with preset Informations without the battle.net launcher.
It is not a compilled exe file or something, you can 100% see the code in what it is doing (no hidden spyware etc.)
