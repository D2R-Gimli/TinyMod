# Install instructions #
------------------------
Step 1: Go to your D2R install folder - like "C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected\" and create in there a new folder called "mods"

Step 2: Extract/copy/move the files/folders from the zip/7z file into this folder.
		It should look like: C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected\mods\tiny\tiny.mpq

Step 3: Go to your folder "C:\Users\YOURUSERNAMEHERE\Saved Games\Diablo II Resurrected" and create a folder called "mods".

Step 4: Go into that mods folder and create a folder called "tiny". In this folder you copy the file "Settings.json" from the zip/7z
		It should look like: C:\Users\YOURUSERNAMEHERE\Saved Games\Diablo II Resurrected\mods\tiny\Settings.json
		You may have to set up your ingame spell hotkeys back again (but only once)

Step 5: Open the Battle.net Launcher, click the "settings" icon (gearwheel), got to "game settings"
		Activate "additional command line arguments"
